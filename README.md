# Christian Ouimet's Coding Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my coding portfolio! 

I'm Christian, currently a student on coding through Uconn in hopes of becoming a professional coder!

## NOTES

* I failed to keep up with my module homework and have been trying desperately to catch up but I will regretfully be sending in this challenge incomplete (Not completing the About section text, some design tweeks to the project section, some of the flex box layout as well as the media queries) but hope to resend the assignment properly and complete in the future! 

* I've managed to complete a majority of my html and css sequences and made it more semantic than my previous assignment. My current portfolio includes a working nav bar that smoothly scrolls to sections about me, my work with working links to the deployed application and working button icon contact section!

* Final note, my apologies for handing in incomplete work like this but I figure it would be better than turning in nothing. I hope to catch up on my modules and be able to keep up with the class asap!
